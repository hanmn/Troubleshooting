# **Service Fabric Support Scripts**
This repository contains scripts that are used by Microsoft Customer Service and Support (CSS) to aid in supporting and troubleshooting Service Fabric clusters. A goal of this repository is provide transparency to Azure customers who want to better understand the scripts being used and to make these scripts accessible for self-help scenarios outside of Microsoft support.

These scripts are generally intended address a particular scenario and are not published as samples of best practices for inclusion in applications.

- For code and scripting examples of best practice see [OneCode](http://aka.ms/onecodesamples), [OneScript](http://aka.ms/onescriptsamples), and the [Microsoft Azure Script Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/scripts/).  
- For documentation on how to build and deploy applications to Microsoft Azure, please see the [Microsoft Azure Documentation Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/).
-	For more information about support in Microsoft Azure see http://azure.microsoft.com/support
